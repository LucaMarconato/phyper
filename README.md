A machine learning pipeline trains models depending on many hyperparamters, and precomputes intermediate resources which depend on a subset of all the hyperparameters. Some hyperparameters should define a unique model, while others are required to be specified for running the pipeline but should not lead to different storage of intermediate resources or model outputs. 

This library simplifies the usage of hyperparameters within pipelines.

Features:
* easy syntax defining hyperparameters
* use hyperparameters in any point within a pipeline
* IDE-enabled code completion (tested with PyCharm)
* generating hashes for final outputs and intermediate resources to avoid redundant computations or resource clashing between different models; the hashes depend on a predefined subset of hyperparameters
* helper functions for using Snakemake as a pipeline manager
